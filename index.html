    <!-- <div class="quote1">"Without asymmetry and imperfection, the universe would be filled with smooth radiation and the world would never exist in all her complex variety."</div>
    <div class="quote2">"The archive is as a result an extension of ourselves. The archive is an instrument for the conduct of affairs or relationships, as are artefact."</div>
    <div class="quote3">"The Internet creates a constant sense of longing, a longing for humanness, as well as a longing for more information."</div>
    <div class="quote4">“Things are one another's sisters, brothers or distant cousins; they improve each other or weaken the other. They look alike in shape or function or they need each other and are complementary.</div>
    <div class="quote5">"The meaning of the archive isn't neutral or objective but becomes as a result of the interaction with a person uncertain and ambiguous."</div>
    <div class="quote6">"That world is not apparent but dynamic. Distinctions between the categories fade." </div>
    <div class="quote7">”The idea that everything is complete, that there are no more uncertainties and that everything can be predicted is quite terrifying, not in the least because it leaves no more room for curiosity.”</div>
    <div class="quote8">”We strive each day, even if unconsciously, to understand the world through inputs, inputs that arrive through senses we didn't even know we had.“</div>
    <div class="quote9">“And with every passing day we enhance our power for sensory discrimination, we find new filters for the lens with which we frame the world to our likeness.”</div>
    <div class="quote10">“For as much as we humans cannot help but deconstruct, unwrap all that we touch, like the layers of a red onion, and then slice and dice until our eyes burn so hot we can see no more and wet with tears must lay down our knife, it is not deconstruction itself that we pursue.“
    </div>
    <div class="quote11">“Deconstruction is the first part of the process of building up. Of connecting, of piecing together all that is fragmented. Humanity is driven, more than anything else, by a want for wholeness.”</div>
    <div class="quote12">“We fragment all that we understand implicitly because we are afraid. Afraid of what we cannot prove, afraid to commit confidently to what we feel but can't easily articulate.”</div>
    <div class="quote13">“We claim rights over moments of time and space. Take snapshots of life and with a click, click, click believe that the moment before us is ours for the taking, ours for the storing.”
    </div>
    <div class="quote14"> “We place fragmented bits of information into localized circuit boards and rely on dendritic absorption to bind this information to the surface of our mind.”
